One message to say 'Hi' and then waiting for a reply, and then another message to say 'How are you?' and then waiting for a reply... IDK... It's just way too much friction for me. If you wanna talk: please call me, invite me to an online meeting, or maybe tell me the address of the coffee shop where we can meet. Otherwise, just send me the actual message you want to say.
